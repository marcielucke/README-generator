## Description

    This project creates a time efficient solution to writing a README file. The application will prompt the user with relevant questions about their project, and generate a template that summarizes their work. This provides users with a more simple and timely deployment of their own application. This project was created using node.js and JavaScript.

![terminal display](./images/creating%20README%20in%20terminal.png)

 To use this application begin by confirming that node.js is installed on your device. This can be done by typing node -v in the terminal. Once confirmed, type in npm init -y. Following this, head to your command line and run the index.js file through node, or by typing " node index.js", from here you will be prompted to answer questions, and a README file will be generated. Simply, relocate the file as needed, and upload!
